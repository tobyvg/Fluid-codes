# Fluid-codes
Some fluid simulation reports and codes on using the finite volume and finite element method on the advection-diffusion equation and Stokes flow.
Code was written in Python 3.7.9 and requires the following packages:

matplotlib  
numpy  
scipy  

These packages are also listed in "requirements.txt". 

How to use:

Each of the codes is used by running the "code.ipynb" file using Jupyter Notebook. The reports give a detailed decription of each of the implemented methods. Assignments are not included as these are not mine to distribute.
